        Description
    </h2>

    <p>
        Lasagna is one of those comforting dishes that brings people together, full of rich, layered flavors. It's an iconic Italian comfort food, known for its satisfying combination of textures and hearty ingredients.
    </p>

    <p>At its core, lasagna is a baked pasta dish made up of wide, flat noodles layered with savory fillings. Each bite offers a contrast of gooey cheese, savory meat or vegetables, and a rich, flavorful sauce. The noodles themselves soak up all the sauces and cheeses, adding a soft, tender texture.

    Typically, there are three main components:

    <ul>
        <li>Pasta Sheets: The wide, slightly wavy sheets of lasagna noodles hold everything together. They can be cooked fresh or dried, and they absorb the sauce as they bake, becoming delightfully tender.</li>

        <li>Meat Sauce: The most traditional version features a hearty Bolognese-style sauce made with ground beef (sometimes a mix of beef and pork), onions, garlic, and tomatoes. The sauce is slow-simmered, often with a splash of wine and herbs, developing a rich and savory flavor that is full of depth.</li>

        <li>Cheese Layers: This is where things get creamy. A rich, creamy ricotta cheese mixture, sometimes enhanced with egg, mozzarella, and Parmesan, forms a decadent filling that blends perfectly with the tangy sauce. The mozzarella on top melts into a gooey, golden, bubbly finish.</li>
    </ul>
